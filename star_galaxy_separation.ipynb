      "Abstract:\n",
      "  Context. Observational studies have widely demonstrated that galaxy physical\n",
      "  properties are strongly affected by the surrounding environment.  On one side,\n",
      "  gas inflows provide galaxies with new fuel for star formation. On the other\n",
      "  side, the high temperatures and densities of the medium are expected to induce\n",
      "  quenching in the star formation. Observations of large structures, in\n",
      "  particular filaments at the cluster outskirts (r>2r200), are currently limited\n",
      "  to the low redshift Universe. Deep and wide photometric data, better if\n",
      "  combined with spectroscopic redshifts, are required to explore several\n",
      "  scenarios on galaxy evolution at intermediate redshift. Aims. We present a\n",
      "  multi-band dataset for the cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (z=0.397), observed in\n",
      "  the context of the Galaxy Assembly as a function of Mass and Environment with\n",
      "  VST (VST-GAME) survey. The project aims at gathering deep (r<24.4) and wide\n",
      "  (approx. 20x20Mpc2) observations at optical (u, g, r, i, VST) wavelengths for\n",
      "  six massive galaxy clusters at 0.2<z<0.6, complemented with near-infrared data\n",
      "  (Y, J, K s, VISTA, ESO public survey GCAV). The aim is to investigate galaxy\n",
      "  evolution in a wide range of stellar masses and environmental conditions. This\n",
      "  work describes the photometric analysis of the cluster and the definition of a\n",
      "  density field, which will be a key ingredient for further studies about galaxy\n",
      "  properties in the cluster outskirts. Methods. We extract sources paying\n",
      "  particular attention to recovering the faintest ones and simultaneously\n",
      "  flagging point sources and sources with photometry affected by artifacts in\n",
      "  the images. We combine all the extractions in a multi-band catalog that is\n",
      "  used to derive photometric redshifts through SED fitting. We then define\n",
      "  cluster memberships up to 5r200 from the cluster core and measure the density\n",
      "  field, comparing galaxy properties in different environments. Results. We\n",
      "  found that the g − r colors show bimodal behaviors in all the environments,\n",
      "  but the peak of the distribution of red galaxies shifts toward redder colors\n",
      "  with increasing density, and the fraction of galaxies in the blue cloud\n",
      "  increases with decreasing density. We also found 3 overdense regions in the\n",
      "  cluster outskirts at r∼5r200. Galaxies in these structures have mean densities\n",
      "  and luminosities similar to the cluster core. The color of galaxies suggests\n",
      "  the presence of evolved galaxy populations, an insight into pre-processing\n",
      "  phenomena over these substructures. We release the multi-band catalog, down to\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "  In the catalog, a unique primary key ({ t GAME\\_ID}), univocally identifies\n",
      "  sources. It is composed of a string containing 19 characters, where four of\n",
      "  them are ``GAME'' and fourteen for the digits hhmmsss-ddmmsss barycentre\n",
      "  coordinate, that we report in degrees ({       t RA}, {        t DEC}). We\n",
      "  also report the parameters of the ellipse that describes the shape of the\n",
      "  objects: the semi-major and semi-minor axes ({    t A} and {      t B}), and\n",
      "  position angle ({    t THETA}), together with the half flux radius ({        t\n",
      "  R\\_50}) and the Kron radius ({        t R\\_Kron}) measured in the $r$ band.\n",
      "  Among all the measured magnitudes, we report three aperture magnitudes inside\n",
      "  1.5, 3, and 4 arcsec diameter ({    t AP\\_15, AP\\_30, AP\\_40}), the Kron\n",
      "  magnitude ({       t Mag\\_Kron}) and the model magnitude obtained from the sum\n",
      "  of the spheroid and disc components of the fitting ({       t Mag\\_Model}), as\n",
      "  well as the PSF magnitude ({ t Mag\\_PSF}). Magnitudes are corrected for the\n",
      "  galactic extinction. We also report in the catalog the adopted corrections ({\n",
      "  t A\\_u, A\\_g, A\\_r, A\\_i, A\\_Y, A\\_J, A\\_Ks}). Finally, we provide the\n",
      "  stellarity index obtained for the $r$ band from  extit{SExtractor} ({    t\n",
      "  SI}) and two additional flags: the star/galaxy flag ({        t NSFLAG\\_r})\n",
      "  and the mask flag ({      t MASK\\_FLAG\\_r}). {    t NSFLAG\\_r} flag is set to\n",
      "  0 for extended objects and greater than zero for point-like sources identified\n",
      "  in the $r$ band. {   t MASK\\_FLAG\\_r} is set to one for objects inside the $r$\n",
      "  band mask and zero otherwise, according to the identification of star haloes.\n",

    "tablemaker.abstract = \"Context. Observational studies have widely demonstrated that galaxy physical properties are strongly affected by the surrounding environment.  On one side, gas inflows provide galaxies with new fuel for star formation. On the other side, the high temperatures and densities of the medium are expected to induce quenching in the star formation. Observations of large structures, in particular filaments at the cluster outskirts (r>2r200), are currently limited to the low redshift Universe. Deep and wide photometric data, better if combined with spectroscopic redshifts, are required to explore several scenarios on galaxy evolution at intermediate redshift. Aims. We present a multi-band dataset for the cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (z=0.397), observed in the context of the Galaxy Assembly as a function of Mass and Environment with VST (VST-GAME) survey. The project aims at gathering deep (r<24.4) and wide (approx. 20x20Mpc2) observations at optical (u, g, r, i, VST) wavelengths for six massive galaxy clusters at 0.2<z<0.6, complemented with near-infrared data (Y, J, K s, VISTA, ESO public survey GCAV). The aim is to investigate galaxy evolution in a wide range of stellar masses and environmental conditions. This work describes the photometric analysis of the cluster and the definition of a density field, which will be a key ingredient for further studies about galaxy properties in the cluster outskirts. Methods. We extract sources paying particular attention to recovering the faintest ones and simultaneously flagging point sources and sources with photometry affected by artifacts in the images. We combine all the extractions in a multi-band catalog that is used to derive photometric redshifts through SED fitting. We then define cluster memberships up to 5r200 from the cluster core and measure the density field, comparing galaxy properties in different environments. Results. We found that the g − r colors show bimodal behaviors in all the environments, but the peak of the distribution of red galaxies shifts toward redder colors with increasing density, and the fraction of galaxies in the blue cloud increases with decreasing density. We also found 3 overdense regions in the cluster outskirts at r∼5r200. Galaxies in these structures have mean densities and luminosities similar to the cluster core. The color of galaxies suggests the presence of evolved galaxy populations, an insight into pre-processing phenomena over these substructures. We release the multi-band catalog, down to the completeness limit r < 24.4 mag\"\n",
    "tablemaker.more_description = \"In the catalog, a unique primary key ({\\tt GAME\\_ID}), univocally identifies sources. It is composed of a string containing 19 characters, where four of them are ``GAME'' and fourteen for the digits hhmmsss-ddmmsss barycentre coordinate, that we report in degrees ({\\tt RA}, {\\tt DEC}). We also report the parameters of the ellipse that describes the shape of the objects: the semi-major and semi-minor axes ({\\tt A} and {\\tt B}), and position angle ({\\tt THETA}), together with the half flux radius ({\\tt R\\_50}) and the Kron radius ({\\tt R\\_Kron}) measured in the $r$ band. Among all the measured magnitudes, we report three aperture magnitudes inside 1.5, 3, and 4 arcsec diameter ({\\tt AP\\_15, AP\\_30, AP\\_40}), the Kron magnitude ({\\tt Mag\\_Kron}) and the model magnitude obtained from the sum of the spheroid and disc components of the fitting ({\\tt Mag\\_Model}), as well as the PSF magnitude ({\\tt Mag\\_PSF}). Magnitudes are corrected for the galactic extinction. We also report in the catalog the adopted corrections ({\\tt A\\_u, A\\_g, A\\_r, A\\_i, A\\_Y, A\\_J, A\\_Ks}). Finally, we provide the stellarity index obtained for the $r$ band from \\textit{SExtractor} ({\\tt SI}) and two additional flags: the star/galaxy flag ({\\tt NSFLAG\\_r}) and the mask flag ({\\tt MASK\\_FLAG\\_r}). {\\tt NSFLAG\\_r} flag is set to 0 for extended objects and greater than zero for point-like sources identified in the $r$ band. {\\tt MASK\\_FLAG\\_r} is set to one for objects inside the $r$ band mask and zero otherwise, according to the identification of star haloes. We also report the measured photometric redshift ({\\tt photo\\_$z$}).\"\n",
